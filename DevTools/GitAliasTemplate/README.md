Git's "alias" feature provides a way for you to create shortcuts for other Git commands, which can save you a lot of time in the long run. If you want to learn more, [I wrote a bit about it here](https://grantwinney.com/what-is-a-git-alias-and-how-do-i-use-it/).

The `*.gitconfig` files in this repo are a collection of some useful aliases I created, some for long git commands or chains of commands, and others for common typos.

If you'd like to use them, you don't have to copy/paste anything. Instead, clone the repository and reference it from within your existing `.gitconfig` file, which has the added benefit of leaving your existing aliases and other settings untouched. Add the following section to your `.gitconfig` file, where `/your/path` is wherever you cloned the repo to.

```
[include]
    path = "/your/path/git-alias-template/alias-shortcuts.gitconfig"
    path = "/your/path/git-alias-template/alias-typos.gitconfig"
    # etc...
```

The `include` section imports settings from other files and merges their functionality without affecting the original config file.

Do you have any especially useful aliases of your own that you couldn't live without? If you want to share them, feel free to [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) and I'll check them out.
