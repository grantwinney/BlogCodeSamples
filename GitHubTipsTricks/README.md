[//]: # (Does anyone remember Bob Ross?)

Life is too short to be alone, too [precious][]. Share it with a friend. Automatically, all of these [beautiful][beauty], [beautiful][beauty] things will happen. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend.

These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Look around, look at what we have. [Beauty][beauty] is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. We must be quiet, soft and gentle.
